The result is the Poona Pact. (In 1933, Gandhi replaces his newspaper “Young India” with “Harijan”, and undertakes a 21-day “self-purification fast” against untouchability.)</li>

                    “Unlike a drop of water which loses its identity when it joins the ocean,
man does not lose his being in the society in which he lives.
Man's life is independent.
He is born not for the development of the society alone, but for the development of his self too.”
